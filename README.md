# ps4-in-browser
Just some recreation me and my team are making of the PS4


If you were wondering a bit of this recreation was made with images, gifs and other stuff, like an embedded music player for ps4 sound effects and whatnot.

some of the apps do work but we are not planning to add actual ps4 games on here yet, maybe free ones if i get permission from the respected developers
but for now, games that were never made for the ps4, or free versions.

the font that we used for the text in the recreation is SST Paneuropean Light, and SST Paneuropean Roman.

Please dont expect everything to be perfect because this project is still in early development and I dont even own a ps4 myself.
